This is a fork of golang x509 package with some extensions.

The file "extensions.go" try to capture all the methods and structures that need to be tampered with.

The file "pqkeys.go" defines the api expected from a PQ/QS key.

I have only tested against IBM's Dilithium implementation so far.

Go is BSD-licensed, ofc
